 Clone of Newsweek website to practice Twitter Bootstrap Framework


> For this project, we are encouraged to try out Twitter’s Bootstrap framework by building a site that actually uses it – Newsweek. The goal is tailor the site with as much as posible using only the Bootstrap built-in clases, and deploy it following the breakpoints for responsiveness that the Newsweek site has.
